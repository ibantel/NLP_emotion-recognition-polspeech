1) Sentiment detection -> then disentangle/ classify negative sentiment into anger, disgust, contempt

2) Topic/ policy area by meta information (session agenda) => policy areas: immigration, climate/ energy policy => most freq keywords by policy area

3) NER: target -> people (ad hominem) / group (party) / policy
	author from meta information (maybe we need more differentiation, e.g. for citations/ referencing other statements => semantic role labeling)

Directions to explore:
1) pre-trained models
- neural nets detecting hate speech
- word embedding models general purpose
 

2) active learning
- how many places


__ELLIOTT ASH__
- develop a NLP tool that detects anger/ disgust
- show it's useful and interesting to apply to political science
- lab experiment: induce anger or disgust, then make people write something
? is there a good literature on psychometric scores for anger or disgust
