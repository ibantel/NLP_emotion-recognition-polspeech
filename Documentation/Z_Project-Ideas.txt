project ideas NLP
- training classifier to detect different sentiments related to AP in speech (disgust, contempt, anger, ...)
- active learning
- NER -> identify statements against: other people (MPs, ...), other groups (factions, parties, ...), policies
	=> has polarization on policy things gone down but polarization on people / groups increased?

identifying anger and disgust

@Elliott: word embeddings => "anger dimension"; does this work?
