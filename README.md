# `NLP_emotion-recognition-polspeech`

This repository contains the project pursued as part of the Summer Institute in Computational Social Sciences (SICSS) Zurich in 2021 (github.com/computational-social-science-zurich/sicss-zurich, )

The project aims to recognize discrete emotions in political speech (speeches in the UK House of commons).

Data: from the *ParlSpeech project* (https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/L4OAKN).

The project has the following structure (incl explanations):
```
NLP_emotion-recognition-polspeech
│   README.md (this readme)
|   documentation.pdf (the final report)
└───code
│       00-House-of-Commons_preparation.R (to preprare the raw data for manipulation in python (.RDS -> .csv)
│       01-HoC_preparation_IB.py (to prepare the raw .csv data for analysis; sentence splitting and running language models)
│       02-HoC_vader-textblob_IB.py (to conduct preliminary analysis with vader and textblob)
│       03-emotion-recognition_with_BERT.ipynb (the actual emotion recognition)
│       create_venv.txt (instructions to create the  venv)
│       package links.txt (links to install packages if/ where needed)
│       plots.r (file to create plots based on the predicted data)
│       sampling_emotive_statements.R (samples for face validity)
└───data/`
    └───BERT-in (data needed in code/03-emotion-recognition_with_BERT.ipynb)
    │       House_of_commons_2019ff_labelled_test.csv (labelled data to train neural model on)
    │       House_of_commons_2019ff_to_predict.csv (data to predict - selected sentences)
    │       isear_preprocessed.csv (ISEAR dataset, https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/isear, for training neural model)
    └───BERT-out (data produced by code/03-emotion-recognition_with_BERT.ipynb)
    │       House_of_commons_predicted.csv (data with predictions)
    │       House_of_commons_validation.csv (predictions on seen data)
    └───preprocessed (data produced by "code/00-..."-"code/02-...", partly not uploaded on GitHub due to space restrictions)
            1-House_of_commons_2019ff_preprocessed_head100.csv (a shortened sample output of "code/01-HoC_preparation_IB.py")
            data-overview.txt (a text file of file names that should be produced when running the code that are saved in "/data/preprocessed")
